# 🗂️ AutoBackup Manager

AutoBackup Manager is a desktop application built with **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **PostgreSQL** that allows users to create automated backup jobs, run them manually, track execution history, visualize results on dashboards, and inspect backup folders through an integrated file explorer.

The goal of this project is to provide a clean, GUI-based backup automation tool designed for learning purposes and real-world usage.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Backup Jobs
- Create, edit, delete backup jobs  
- Define:
  - source folder  
  - destination folder  
  - schedule type  
  - interval (minutes)  
  - job activation (enable/disable)

### ✅ Manual Backup Execution
- Run any job immediately
- Validation of paths (missing folders, permissions)
- ZIP archive creation with timestamp naming
- Detailed logging for success and error cases

### ✅ Backup History
- Shows all past executions:
  - run ID  
  - job ID  
  - status (success / error)  
  - start time  
  - end time  
  - message preview  
- “View details” window with full log and output file path

### ✅ Dashboard / Analytics
- Bar chart: **Backups per day**
- Pie chart: **Success vs Failure**
- Summary statistics:
  - total runs  
  - success  
  - failure  
  - average duration  

### ✅ Destination Folder Viewer
- Internal Tkinter window to list folder contents
- Scrollable file viewer  
- Option to open with:
  - system file manager (xdg-open, open, explorer.exe)  
  - fallback for terminal file managers  
- Graceful error handling when the path doesn't exist

### ✅ Clean Project Architecture
- `backup_engine.py` — core backup logic  
- `scheduler.py` — scheduling system (manual mode ready, auto mode coming soon)  
- `gui.py` — graphical interface (Tkinter)  
- `models.py` — SQLAlchemy ORM models  
- `db.py` — database session handling

- **Tkinter** (GUI)
- **PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy**  
- **matplotlib** (dashboard charts)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (database container)
- **Pyright** for static type checking
